# PunkTech Manifesto

**Engineering Against Inefficiency**

---

## What is PunkTech?

PunkTech is a philosophy and methodology for approaching problems with rigorous engineering thinking, refusing mainstream inefficiency, and sharing knowledge freely.

**Not a company. Not a product. A way of thinking.**

---

## Core Values

**Four pillars support everything we build:**

### Intégrité (Integrity)
Actions aligned with values. No hidden incentives. No compromise between what we say and what we do.

### Probité (Intellectual Honesty)
Truth over ego. Research over guessing. Admit mistakes. Verify claims. Reconstruct rather than fabricate.

### Transparence (Transparency)
Open methodology. Document limitations. Disclose tools used. No black boxes. Anyone can verify our work.

### Penser "Out of the Box" (Non-Conventional Thinking)
Question mainstream. Look outside the industry. Refuse "everyone does X" as justification. Find optimal, not popular.

**Together, these create rigorous engineering you can trust.**

**Remove one pillar, the whole structure fails.**

---

## The Five Principles

### 1. Open Standards Over Proprietary Lock-in

**The Problem:**
Proprietary ecosystems trap users. Vendor lock-in creates dependency. Closed standards die when companies abandon them.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Choose open, proven standards. Prefer protocols over products. Ensure longevity through openness.

**Examples:**
- ✅ MIDI protocol (40 years, still relevant, open standard)
- ✅ DirectInput (decades old, universal compatibility)
- ✅ Markdown documentation (readable forever, no proprietary format)
- ❌ Proprietary gaming ecosystems (locked, expensive, fragile)
- ❌ Closed APIs (die when company pivots)

**Principle:**
> "Build on standards that outlive companies."

---

### 2. Rigorous Engineering Over Marketing Bullshit

**The Problem:**
Marketing creates artificial needs. Feature lists replace substance. "New and improved" hides regression.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Requirements-driven design. Test empirically. Document honestly. Question claims. Measure results.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Test for 7 weeks before claiming "works perfectly"
- ✅ Document what's tested vs what's theory
- ✅ Admit limitations ("MW5 has 2-device UI limit")
- ✅ Show methodology, not just results
- ❌ "Best HOTAS setup!" (untested, unverified)
- ❌ "Revolutionary new technology!" (marketing hyperbole)

**Principle:**
> "Show your work. Prove your claims. Admit your limits."

---

### 3. Intelligent DIY Over Consumer Marketing Traps

**The Problem:**
Gaming companies design products for profit margins, not customer value. Marketing creates artificial needs and pushes overpriced "gaming" solutions. Consumers accept mediocrity because "everyone else buys it."

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Question mainstream inefficiency. Look outside the industry for better solutions. Refuse marketing narratives. Choose based on engineering merit, not branding.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Professional audio MIDI controllers ($150, 80 inputs, pro-grade durability)
- ✅ Looking in music stores, not gaming stores
- ✅ Ignoring "gaming" branding premiums
- ❌ Gaming buttonboxes ($500, 20 inputs, cheap plastic, "gaming" logo tax)
- ❌ "Everyone buys this brand" (appeal to popularity, not merit)
- ❌ "You need our ecosystem" (vendor lock-in trap)

**Principle:**
> "Refuse marketing narratives. Seek optimal solutions, not popular products."

**We don't blame consumers for falling into traps. We blame companies for setting them.**

---

### 4. Free Knowledge Over Short-term Profit

**The Problem:**
Paywalls, affiliate links, sponsored content corrupt objectivity. Short-term monetization destroys long-term credibility.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Share knowledge freely. Build credibility through value, not through sales. Money follows trust, not the reverse.

**My father taught me:**
> "Tu veux faire de l'argent? Oublie l'argent."
> 
> ("You want to make money? Forget about money.")

**Focus on creating value. Money comes as a consequence, not a goal.**

**Examples:**
- ✅ Complete guides shared freely (no paywall)
- ✅ No affiliate links (no hidden incentives)
- ✅ Honest about limitations (tested vs not tested)
- ✅ CC BY-SA 4.0 license (shareable, improvable forever)
- ❌ "Click my affiliate link!" (corrupted objectivity)
- ❌ Sponsored content (hidden incentives)
- ❌ Paywalled "premium" content (gatekeeping knowledge)

**Principle:**
> "Give value freely. Trust builds. Opportunities follow."

---

### 5. Pragmatism Over Ideology

**The Problem:**
Ideological purity over practical results. "Should work in theory" vs "works in practice." Stubbornness disguised as principles.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Use the right tool for the job, even if it's not your favorite. Document reality, not ideals. Adapt when evidence shows better path.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Use Windows for simulation (despite Linux preference) because vJoy/UCR are Windows-native
- ✅ Document what actually works, not what "should" work
- ✅ Pivot when data shows better approach (Linux → Windows after testing)
- ❌ "I refuse to use Windows on principle" (ignoring practical reality)
- ❌ "This should work because X" (theory over empirical test)

**Principle:**
> "Optimize for results, not ideology. Document reality honestly."

---

## PunkTech in Practice

### What PunkTech Is:

**A methodology for:**
- Identifying inefficient mainstream solutions
- Researching alternatives rigorously
- Testing empirically before claiming
- Documenting methodology transparently
- Sharing knowledge freely

**Applied to:**
- Technology projects (MIDI simulation setup)
- Daily life decisions (e-bike vs car analysis)
- Work conflicts (labor dispute documentation)
- Consumer choices (reject marketing, demand evidence)

**Universal thinking framework, not just tech projects.**

---

### What PunkTech Is NOT:

**Not:**
- ❌ Anti-commercial (commerce is fine, dishonest marketing isn't)
- ❌ Elitist gatekeeping (we share knowledge freely)
- ❌ "Always DIY everything" (use what works, buy when appropriate)
- ❌ Tech-only (methodology applies to any domain)
- ❌ Perfectionism (done > perfect, document limitations)

**Not ideology. Pragmatic methodology.**

---

## The PunkTech Process

**How to approach a problem the PunkTech way:**

### 1. Question the Mainstream

**Don't accept "everyone does X" as justification.**

Ask:
- Why is this the common solution?
- Who benefits from this approach?
- Is this optimal or just marketed?

---

### 2. Define Requirements Rigorously

**What do you actually need?**

Not:
- ❌ "I need a gaming buttonbox" (solution, not requirement)

But:
- ✅ "I need 100+ inputs for complex aircraft" (requirement)
- ✅ "Budget: $500 max" (constraint)
- ✅ "Must work across multiple games" (constraint)

**Requirements → Solutions, not the reverse**

---

### 3. Research Outside the Box

**Look beyond the obvious industry.**

- Simulation inputs? Check music industry (MIDI controllers)
- Urban transport? Check cargo bikes, not just cars
- Work conflict? Check labor law, not just company policy

**Best solutions often exist adjacent to problem space.**

---

### 4. Test Empirically

**Theory < Reality**

- Don't assume it works (test it)
- Don't believe marketing (verify it)
- Don't trust "should work" (make it work, document results)

**Data > opinions**

---

### 5. Document Honestly

**What worked:**
- Specify exactly
- Provide evidence (screenshots, data, testing duration)

**What didn't work:**
- Admit it
- Explain why
- Document workarounds or alternatives

**What's unknown:**
- Don't guess
- State clearly "not tested"
- Encourage community validation

**Honesty > appearing perfect**

---

### 6. Share Freely

**Knowledge compounds when shared.**

- Document methodology (how you solved it)
- License openly (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- Enable community (contributions welcome)
- No gatekeeping (paywalls corrupt)

**Free knowledge > short-term profit**

---

## Who PunkTech Is For

**You might align with PunkTech if:**

- ✅ You question "everyone does it this way"
- ✅ You read manuals for understanding, not just to follow steps
- ✅ You value methodology over shortcuts
- ✅ "But WHY?" is your natural response
- ✅ You've spent hours researching a small purchase
- ✅ Marketing bullshit annoys you deeply
- ✅ You prefer open standards over proprietary lock-in
- ✅ You share knowledge freely

**You probably won't align if:**

- ❌ "Just tell me what to buy" is your approach
- ❌ You trust marketing claims without verification
- ❌ Understanding isn't important, only results
- ❌ Quick and easy > deep and comprehensive
- ❌ Paywalls seem reasonable for knowledge

**Not for everyone. That's OK.**

---

## PunkTech Origin

**December 2025:** Frustrated with $500 gaming buttonboxes offering 20 inputs.

**Question:** "Why am I constrained by gaming industry thinking?"

**Research:** Musicians need TONS of inputs → MIDI controllers exist → Pro-grade, cheaper, better.

**Realization:** This pattern repeats everywhere. Marketing traps consumers into suboptimal products.

**Decision:** Document the methodology. Share freely. Help others escape the traps.

**PunkTech born:** Not as company, as philosophy.
