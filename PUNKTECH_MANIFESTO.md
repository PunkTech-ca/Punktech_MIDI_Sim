# The PunkTech Manifesto
## Engineering Against Inefficiency

**Version 1.0 - February 2026**

---

## What is PunkTech?

PunkTech is a philosophy of technological sovereignty, rigorous engineering, and pragmatic problem-solving applied to any domain where inefficiency, bullshit, or vendor lock-in exists.

**It's not a company. Not a product. Not a service.**

**It's a mindset.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Open Standards Over Proprietary Systems

**The Problem:**
Proprietary systems create vendor lock-in. They die when the company dies. They force upgrades on their schedule, not yours.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Use open standards that have proven longevity. MIDI (40 years old). DirectInput (Windows standard). vJoy (open-source). Standards that will exist in 2036.

**Examples:**
- ✅ MIDI controllers for simulation (40-year standard)
- ✅ Open-source software stack (vJoy, UCR)
- ❌ Proprietary gaming buttonboxes (die when company pivots)
- ❌ Closed ecosystems (locked to one vendor)

**Principle:**
> "Build on foundations that last decades, not products that last until the next marketing cycle."

---

### 2. Rigorous Engineering Over Marketing Bullshit

**The Problem:**
Marketing sells features. Engineering solves problems. Most products optimize for marketing, not function.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Validation

1. **Identify the actual problem** (not what marketing says the problem is)
2. **Research constraints** (technical limitations, compatibility)
3. **Design intentionally** (not accidentally)
4. **Validate empirically** (test, measure, document)

**Examples:**
- ✅ Requirements-driven design (research 8 games, design for most restrictive)
- ✅ Empirical validation (test on real hardware, document results)
- ❌ "RGB makes it faster" (marketing bullshit)
- ❌ "Pro gamer approved" (appeal to authority, not data)

**Principle:**
> "Show your work. Provide evidence. No claims without proof."

---

### 3. Intelligent DIY Over Consumer Marketing Traps

**The Problem:**
Gaming companies design products for profit margins, not customer value. Marketing creates artificial needs and pushes overpriced "gaming" solutions. Consumers accept mediocrity because "everyone else buys it."

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Question mainstream inefficiency. Look outside the industry for better solutions. Refuse marketing narratives. Choose based on engineering merit, not branding.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Professional audio MIDI controllers ($150, 80 inputs, pro-grade durability)
- ✅ Looking in music stores, not gaming stores
- ✅ Ignoring "gaming" branding premiums
- ❌ Gaming buttonboxes ($500, 20 inputs, cheap plastic, "gaming" logo tax)
- ❌ "Everyone buys this brand" (appeal to popularity, not merit)
- ❌ "You need our ecosystem" (vendor lock-in trap)

**Principle:**
> "Refuse marketing narratives. Seek optimal solutions, not popular products."

**We don't blame consumers for falling into traps. We blame companies for setting them.**

---

### 4. Free Knowledge Over Short-term Profit

**The Problem:**
Paywalls, affiliate links, sponsored content corrupt objectivity. Short-term monetization destroys long-term credibility.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Share knowledge freely. Build credibility through value, not through sales. Money follows trust, not the reverse.

**My father taught me:**
> "Tu veux faire de l'argent? Oublie l'argent."
> 
> ("You want to make money? Forget about money.")

**Focus on creating value. Money comes as a consequence, not a goal.**

**Examples:**
- ✅ Complete guides shared freely (no paywall)
- ✅ No affiliate links (no hidden incentives)
- ✅ Honest about limitations (tested vs not tested)
- ❌ "Buy through my link" (conflict of interest)
- ❌ Sponsored content disguised as review

**Principle:**
> "Credibility compounds. Profit extracted early destroys it."

---

### 5. Pragmatism Over Ideology

**The Problem:**
Ideological purity often conflicts with practical solutions. The "right" tool on paper may be wrong in practice.

**The PunkTech Approach:**
Use the right tool for the job. Even if it's not your favorite tool. Even if it conflicts with your preferences.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Windows for simulation (despite Linux preference) - games designed for it, mature ecosystem
- ✅ Dual-boot (use each OS for its strengths)
- ❌ "Linux only no matter what" (ideology over pragmatism)
- ❌ Fighting the OS instead of solving the problem

**Principle:**
> "The goal is the solution, not proving a point about tools."

---

## Origin Story

### August 2025: PunkTech v1 - Digital Sovereignty

PunkTech began as a response to forced GAFAM taxation in Canada. The goal: build a self-hosted cloud infrastructure using Docker Swarm, accessible via personal domain (punktech.ca), with Traefik/LetsEncrypt for HTTPS.

**The vision:** Technological sovereignty. Control your own data. Open standards.

**October 2025:** Catastrophic server failure. Project went dormant.

---

### December 2025: PunkTech v2 - Resurrection Through Simulation

**The pivot:**
- Childhood dream of flight simulation activated
- Unexpected $2000 CAD windfall
- Started building simulation setup
- Discovered mainstream solutions (buttonboxes) were inefficient and overpriced

**The realization:**
> "Why am I paying $500 for 20 plastic buttons when $150 professional MIDI controllers give me 80 pro-grade inputs?"

**The application:**
Applied PunkTech principles (open standards, rigorous engineering, intelligent DIY) to simulation peripherals.

**The result:**
7 weeks, $2000, 195+ inputs, architecture that respects universal constraints, fully documented and shared freely.

---

### February 2026: PunkTech Manifesto

**The understanding:**

PunkTech is not about simulation. Not about Docker. Not about any specific project.

**PunkTech is a philosophy applicable to any domain where inefficiency exists.**

The projects change. The principles remain.

## About the Author

I am not a licensed engineer. I am a Linux sysadmin / system architect / IT operator.

**Background:**
- Stage/audio technical training (AEC - Sound/Lighting)
- 13 years in IT networking and systems
- Convergence of audio + IT + engineering mindset = PunkTech

**Philosophy:**
Intolérance à l'inefficacité (intolerance of inefficiency) - a family trait.

My father built a complete Canadian coin collection (1800s-present) in 2 years via systematic bank box sorting.

My brother went from novice to professional bassist in 2 years.

I built a tier-1 simulation setup in 7 weeks.

**The pattern:** Refuse mediocrity. Optimize relentlessly. Execute methodically.

## PunkTech in Practice

### The Methodology

**When facing any problem:**

1. **Question the mainstream solution**
   - Why is everyone doing it this way?
   - Is it actually optimal, or just popular?
   - Are there better solutions outside this industry?

2. **Research rigorously**
   - What are the actual technical constraints?
   - What standards exist?
   - What has longevity?

3. **Design intentionally**
   - Requirements-driven (not impulse-driven)
   - Respect constraints
   - Plan for evolution

4. **Validate empirically**
   - Test on real use cases
   - Measure results
   - Document honestly (including failures)

5. **Share freely**
   - Document methodology, not just results
   - Enable others to adapt, not just copy
   - Build credibility through value

---

### Examples Across Domains

**Simulation Peripherals (Current Project):**
- Problem: Buttonboxes overpriced, proprietary, limited
- Solution: Professional MIDI controllers (open standard, pro-grade, affordable)
- Result: [MIDI Sim Setup Guide](/projects/midi-sim-setup)

**System Administration (Daily Work):**
- Problem: Vendor solutions complex, expensive, locked-in
- Solution: Open-source stack, standards-based, self-maintained
- Result: Lower cost, higher control, transferable knowledge

**Decision-Making (Life):**
- Problem: Claims without evidence
- Solution: Verify facts, provide proof (e.g., dictionary screenshot)
- Result: Waste less time on bullshit arguments

**The philosophy scales.**

---

## PunkTech vs Other Philosophies

### **PunkTech is NOT:**

❌ **Anarchist / Anti-Authority**
- We question authority, but accept valid expertise
- We verify, not reject automatically

❌ **Minimalist / Ascetic**
- We're not against spending money
- We're against spending money INEFFICIENTLY

❌ **Open-Source Purist**
- We prefer open standards
- But we're pragmatic (Windows for simulation)

❌ **Anti-Corporate**
- We work with companies when it makes sense
- We just refuse bullshit and lock-in

---

### **PunkTech IS:**

✅ **Skeptical but evidence-based**
✅ **Value-focused, not cost-focused**
✅ **Pragmatic, not ideological**
✅ **Engineering-driven, not marketing-driven**

---

## Integrity and Honesty

### Core Values

**Transparency:**
- Document failures, not just successes
- Admit limitations
- No overpromising

**No Hidden Incentives:**
- No affiliate links
- No sponsored content
- No financial conflicts of interest

**Intellectual Honesty:**
- Use of AI assistance disclosed (Gemini, Claude)
- Sources cited
- "I don't know" is acceptable

**Example from MIDI Guide:**
- "Tested only on Il-2 Great Battles"
- "Other games should work but not validated"
- "Joystick Gremlin failed, UCR succeeded"
- "UCR config could be better organized"

**Honesty builds credibility. Overpromising destroys it.**

---

## The Linux Detour: Pragmatism in Action

### December 2025: The Attempt

I tried to build the MIDI simulation setup on Linux first (CachyOS specifically). My background is Linux sysadmin - it's my comfort zone.

**The problems:**
- MIDI routing complex (JACK, ALSA, pipewire)
- vJoy alternatives limited and unmaintained
- Game compatibility through Proton/Wine unreliable
- DirectInput emulation problematic
- Too many layers, too much instability

**The realization (late December):**
> "I'm fighting the OS instead of building the solution."

**The decision:**
Created Windows 11 dual-boot specifically for simulation.

---

### Why This Was Right

**Not compromise. Not selling out. Engineering decision.**

1. ✅ Simplified middleware stack (native DirectInput)
2. ✅ Mature ecosystem (MIDI-OX, vJoy proven)
3. ✅ Game compatibility (designed for Windows)
4. ✅ Reproducibility (broader audience)
5. ✅ Sustainability (Windows sim ecosystem stable long-term)

**Principle 5: Pragmatism Over Ideology**

I prefer Linux. But the goal was "optimal simulation setup," not "prove Linux works for everything."

**Use the right tool for the job.**

---

## Applications Beyond Technology

### The PunkTech Mindset

**Daily life example: The Facebook Dictionary Screenshot**

**Situation:**
Someone claimed "historicité" isn't a word.

**Typical response:**
Argue emotionally, back-and-forth debate.

**PunkTech response:**
Screenshot of dictionary definition. Posted. Done.

**No argumentation. Just facts.**

---

### Transferable to Any Domain

**Home renovation:**
- Question contractor recommendations
- Research building codes yourself
- Verify materials are actually optimal

**Car purchase:**
- Question dealer claims
- Research actual reliability data
- Look outside mainstream brands

**Career decisions:**
- Question "everyone does X"
- Research actual market data
- Build demonstrable portfolio vs credentials

**Investment:**
- Question financial advisor incentives
- Research fee structures
- Verify historical data

**The methodology is universal.**

---

## Building a PunkTech Portfolio

### Why This Matters

**Traditional credentials:**
- Diplomas: Prove you passed exams
- Certifications: Prove you memorized material
- **Problem: Everyone has these. Commoditized.**

**PunkTech portfolio:**
- Projects: Prove you BUILD solutions
- Documentation: Prove you THINK methodically
- Community use: Prove you CREATE VALUE
- **Result: Differentiation. Demonstrable expertise.**

---

### The Strategy

**punktech.ca becomes:**

Not just "a guide website."

But: **Personal engineering portfolio demonstrating methodology across domains.**

```
punktech.ca/
├── Philosophy (this manifesto)
├── Projects
│   ├── MIDI Sim Setup (completed Feb 2026)
│   ├── [Home Networking] (future)
│   └── [Audio Architecture] (future)
└── About (who I am)
```

**Each project:**
- Demonstrates same principles
- Different domain
- Same rigorous methodology

**Result: Credibility compounds.**

---

### Career Application

**In 3-5 years:**

**Interview question:**
> "Tell me about a complex system you've architected."

**Response:**
> "I have my portfolio at punktech.ca. Let me show you..."

*[Opens laptop, shows site, walks through architecture, demonstrates methodology]*

**Interviewer sees:**
- ✅ Real projects (not just claims)
- ✅ Rigorous documentation
- ✅ Community validation (people use it)
- ✅ Clear methodology (transferable)
- ✅ Communication skills (well-written guides)

**Result: Instant credibility.**

**Better than any diploma or certification.**

---

## Living Document

**This manifesto is version 1.0.**

It will evolve as:
- New principles emerge from practice
- New projects demonstrate applications
- Community feedback refines concepts

**PunkTech is not dogma.**

**It's a living philosophy, refined through real-world application.**

## Final Thoughts

### On Money

> "Tu veux faire de l'argent? Oublie l'argent."

Build credibility. Create value. Share freely.

Money comes as consequence, not goal.

### On Perfection

> "Functionality > Aesthetics"

Ship working solutions. Iterate. Document honestly.

Perfect is enemy of done.

### On Ideology

> "Pragmatism > Ideology. Always."

Use what works. Adapt to constraints.

The goal is the solution, not the purity.
